<li>Added the ability to pass objects to the <a href="../general/views.html">view loading function</a>: $this->load->view('my_view', <var>$object</var>);</li>
<li>Added <kbd>getwhere</kbd> function to <a href="../libraries/database/active_record.html">Active Record class</a>.</li>

<h2>Version 1.3</h2>
<p>Release Date: April 3, 2006</p>

<ul>
<li>Added support for <a href="models.html">Models</a>.</li>
<li>Redesigned the database libraries to support additional RDBMs (Postgre, MySQLi, etc.).</li>
<li>Redesigned the <a href="../libraries/database/active_record.html">Active Record class</a> to enable more varied types of queries with simpler syntax, and advanced features like JOINs.</li>
<li>Added a feature to the database class that lets you run <a href="../libraries/database/call_function.html">custom function calls</a>.</li>
<li>Added support for <a href="controllers.html">private functions</a> in your controllers.  Any controller function name that starts with an underscore will not be served by a URI request.</li>
<li>Added the ability to pass your own initialization parameters to your <a href="creating_libraries.html">custom core libraries</a> when using $this->load->library()</li>
<li>Added support for running standard <a href="urls.html">query string URLs</a>.  These can be optionally enabled in your config file.</li>
<li>Added the ability to  <a href="urls.html">specify a "suffix"</a>, which will be appended to your URLs.  For example, you could add .html to your URLs, making them appear static. This feature is enabled in your config file.</li>
<li>Added a new error template for use with native PHP errors.</li>
<li>Added "alternator" function in the <a href="../helpers/string_helper.html">string helpers</a>.</p>
<li>Removed slashing from the input class. After much debate we decided to kill this feature.</li>
<li>Change the commenting style in the scripts to the PEAR standard so that IDEs and tools like phpDocumenter can harvest the comments.</li>
<li>Added better class and function name-spacing to avoid collisions with user developed classes. All Code Igniter classes are now prefixed with <dfn>CI_</dfn> and
all controller methods are prefixed with <dfn>_ci</dfn> to avoid controller collisions. A list of reserved function names can be <a href="controllers.html">found here</a>.</li>
<li>Redesigned how the "CI" super object is referenced, depending on whether PHP 4 or 5 is being run, since PHP 5 allows a more graceful way to manage objects that utilizes a bit less resources.</li>
<li>Deprecated: <var>$this->db->use_table()</var> has been deprecated. Please read the <a href="../libraries/database/active_record.html">Active Record</a> page for information.</li>
<li>Deprecated: <var>$this->db->smart_escape_str()</var> has been deprecated. Please use this instead: <var>$this->db->escape()</var></li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the exception handler which was preventing some PHP errors from showing up.</li>
<li>Fixed a typo in the URI class.  $this->total_segment() should be plural: $this->total_segments()</li>
<li>Fixed some typos in the default calendar template</li>
<li>Fixed some typos in the user guide</li>
</ul>








<h2>Version 1.2</h2>
<p>Release Date: March 21, 2006</p>

<ul>
<li>Redesigned some internal aspects of the framework to resolve scoping problems that surfaced during the beta tests. The problem was most notable when instantiating classes in your constructors, particularly if those classes in turn did work in their constructors.</li>
<li>Added a global function named <a href="ancillary_classes.html">get_instance()</a> allowing the main Code Igniter object to be accessible throughout your own classes.</li>
<li>Added new <a href="../helpers/file_helper.html">File Helper</a>:  delete_files()</li>
<li>Added new <a href="../helpers/url_helper.html">URL Helpers</a>:  base_url(), index_page()</li>
<li>Added the ability to create your own <a href="creating_libraries.html">core libraries</a> and store them in your local application directory.</li>
<li>Added an <kbd>overwrite</kbd> option to the <a href="../libraries/file_uploading.html">Upload class</a>, enabling files to be overwritten rather than having the file name appended.</li>
<li>Added Javascript Calendar plugin.</li>
<li>Added search feature to user guide.  Note: This is done using Google, which at the time of this writing has not crawled all the pages of the docs.</li>
<li>Updated the parser class so that it allows tag pars within other tag pairs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the DB "where" function.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that was preventing custom config files to be auto-loaded.</li>

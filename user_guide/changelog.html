<li>Redesigned the database libraries to support additional RDBMs (Postgre, MySQLi, etc.).</li>
<li>Redesigned the <a href="./database/active_record.html">Active Record class</a> to enable more varied types of queries with simpler syntax, and advanced features like JOINs.</li>
<li>Added a feature to the database class that lets you run <a href="./database/call_function.html">custom function calls</a>.</li>
<li>Added support for <a href="controllers.html">private functions</a> in your controllers.  Any controller function name that starts with an underscore will not be served by a URI request.</li>

all controller methods are prefixed with <dfn>_ci</dfn> to avoid controller collisions. A list of reserved function names can be <a href="controllers.html">found here</a>.</li>
<li>Redesigned how the "CI" super object is referenced, depending on whether PHP 4 or 5 is being run, since PHP 5 allows a more graceful way to manage objects that utilizes a bit less resources.</li>
<li>Deprecated: <var>$this->db->use_table()</var> has been deprecated. Please read the <a href="./database/active_record.html">Active Record</a> page for information.</li>

<li>Fixed a typo in the URI class.  $this->total_segment() should be plural: $this->total_segments()</li>

<ul>
